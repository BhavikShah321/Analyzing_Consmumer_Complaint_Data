    "To solve this question, I first dropped the rows which had a null value in the State column. This was for simplicity sake. In future projects, I will come up with creative strategies to fill in those null values. I then created an empty dictionary called state_company that would hold the final result. Afterwards, I got a list of unique values in the state column and assigned it to states. I then ran a for loop that iterated over the states list and for each iteration, it first selected the rows in the dataframe where the state column was equal to the state that was currently running in the loop and assigned it to selected_state_data. Then, it counted the number of times each company had received a complaint from that state and assigned the series to companies_by_complaints. Afterwards, the Top_company variable was assigned the name of the company that received the most complaints in that state and Number_complaints_of_top_company variable was assigned the number of complaints that company received. Finally, the state_company dictionary was appeneded with the key being the name of the state and the value being another dictionary that contained top_company as key and Number_complaints_of_top_company as value. Once all the states from states list had been iterated over, the loop broke and state_company dictionary was displayed. "
